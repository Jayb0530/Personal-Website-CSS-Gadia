<h1>News</h1>
<h1>ChatGPT can now search your entire chat history and find old convos.</h1>

<p>Yesterday, OpenAI announced via X/Twitter that they’ve started rolling out a new feature for the web version of ChatGPT that lets you search through your past conversations with the AI chatbot.
<br>
<br>
For a while now, you’ve been able to see a history of ChatGPT conversations you’ve had, organized by date, in the left-side navigation panel conversations from Today, from Yesterday, from the Previous 7 days, and the Previous 30 days.
<br>

<br>
<br>
With this update, you’ll be able to use the new search button at the top-left of the ChatGPT interface to open a pop-up modal that you can use to start a new chat or search through all previous conversations. It can be helpful for referencing a past message or continuing a particular chat.
<br>
<br>
ChatGPT’s new search feature has already started rolling out to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers, while Enterprise and Edu subscribers will get access within the next week and Free users will have to wait about a month before they can start using it.</p>
